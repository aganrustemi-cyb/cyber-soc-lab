# Cybersecurity SOC Home Lab — Full Stack Defensive/Offensive Architecture

## 🎯 Purpose of This Lab Setup

This lab setup documents the architecture and selected tools used to replicate a realistic Security Operations Center (SOC) environment. It is designed to demonstrate hands-on experience with both offensive simulation and defensive telemetry collection, detection, and response workflows, emulating real-world enterprise security operations.

The goal of this setup is to:

--Deploy foundational security tooling that mirrors production SOC stacks

--Generate meaningful telemetry from simulated attacker activity

--Correlate and analyze logs across network, endpoint, and SIEM platforms

--Support incident investigation workflows with case management and automated enrichment

--Integrate threat intelligence into detection logic and alert triage
